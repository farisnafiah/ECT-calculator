# ECT-calculator
This ECT calculator provides the responses from a hall-effect sensor of an eddy current testing (ECT) probe for nondestructive-testing (NDT) purposes. It is intended for self-practise on Node, ExpressJS, Javascript on browser and MathJS. The calculation is made on server to avoid the use of expensive computation power on client's browser.

The calculation takes <10 s, so please be patient🙏.
