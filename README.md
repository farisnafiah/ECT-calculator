# ECT-calculator
This ECT calculator provides the responses from a hall-effect sensor of an eddy current testing (ECT) probe for nondestructive-testing (NDT) purposes. It is intended for self-practise on Node, ExpressJS, Javascript on browser and MathJS. The calculation is made on server to avoid the use of expensive computation power on client's browser.

The calculation is based on ETREE model developed by [Yong Li](https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/22995/61B473A0-2F0F-4AEB-9E68-D99384F26BD3.pdf).

The calculation takes ~15 s, so please be patientüôè.
